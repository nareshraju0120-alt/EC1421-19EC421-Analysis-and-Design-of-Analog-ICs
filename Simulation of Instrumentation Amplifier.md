# Simulation of Instrumentation Amplifier

## AIM:

 To Design and simulate the Instrumentation amplifier circuit using LT-Spice.
 
## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
LT-Spice

## PROCEDURE:
1. Double click on LT-Spice icon. 
2. New schematic window open. 
3. Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram . 
4. Complete the connection. 
5. Save the file by giving file name. 
6. Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude 
time delay stop time value. 
7. Click on the run option ->simulation window opens->place the probe ->output graph is 
obtained.
